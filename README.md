# credit-risk-classification

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that performs a credit risk analysis using a logistic regression model. The notebook uses Python libraries like pandas and sklearn to process and analyze the data.

Summary:

We looked at some financial data to figure out if we could predict certain things. We wanted to see if we could guess the outcome of some variables. We used a process called machine learning to do this, which involved a few steps and some methods like LogisticRegression.

Results
We used two different machine learning models and hereâ€™s what we found:

Machine Learning Model 1:

Accuracy: It got things right 99% of the time.
Precision: It was perfect for healthy loans and pretty good for high-risk loans.
Recall: It was perfect for healthy loans and pretty good for high-risk loans.
Machine Learning Model 2:

Accuracy: It got things right 99% of the time.
Precision: It was almost perfect for both healthy and high-risk loans.
Recall: It was almost perfect for both healthy and high-risk loans.

Both models did a great job at figuring out if a loan was healthy or high-risk. They were right most of the time and made very few mistakes. This makes them really useful for assessing credit risk
